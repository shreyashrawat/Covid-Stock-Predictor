# Covid-Stock-Predictor
This combination of time series model and XG Regressor gives the stock prediction witha loss less than 0.002.

Despite the pandemic situation creating a quandary all over the economic condition, this new proposed model was able to predict the current stock prices with great accuracy whose mean squared loss is less than 0.002. This new combination of LSTM and XG Regressor has proven to be a great combination for prediction of stock indexes.

The LSTM is used for determining the Put call ratio which is a time dependent factor which is then combined with other factors and is fed into an XG regressor which predicts the final stock prices.
